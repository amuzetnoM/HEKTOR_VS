# Welcome to Hektor Research

We're excited to launch our research blog, a space dedicated to sharing our findings, insights, and explorations in vector database technology.

## What to Expect

This blog will feature:

- **Technical Deep Dives**: Detailed explorations of algorithms, optimizations, and implementation strategies
- **Research Updates**: Progress reports on ongoing research initiatives
- **Industry Analysis**: Perspectives on the evolving landscape of vector databases and AI infrastructure
- **Best Practices**: Practical guidance for building production-ready systems

## Our Mission

At Hektor, we believe that advancing the field requires open collaboration and knowledge sharing. This blog is our contribution to the community.

## Featured Topics

Our upcoming content will cover:

### Vector Space Foundations
Understanding the mathematical underpinnings of high-dimensional similarity search, from metric spaces to the curse of dimensionality.

### Graph-Based Search
Deep dives into HNSW and other navigable small world structures that power modern approximate nearest neighbor search.

### Quantization Techniques
Exploring perceptual quantization, product quantization, and emerging approaches like neural latent compression.

### Systems Architecture
Building scalable, distributed vector databases that can handle billions of vectors with sub-millisecond latency.

## Stay Connected

Follow along as we publish new research, share our learnings, and engage with the broader community. We welcome feedback, discussions, and collaboration opportunities.
